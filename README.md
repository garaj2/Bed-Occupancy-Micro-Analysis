# Bed-Occupancy-Micro-Analysis
## Business Question
Assess the Bed Occupancy of a Tertiary Hospital by Department. Which Departments have the highest and lowest rates of Occupancy?

## Data Source
Synthetic Hospital Bed Capacity and ICU Load Dataset <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/endernel/capacity-of-hospitals-bed>

## Metrics 
Total Occupancy Percentage: (Number of Filled Beds)/(Total Number of Beds)
ICU Occupancy Percentage: (Number of Filled ICU Beds)/(Total Number of ICU Beds)
Non-ICU Occupancy Percentage: (Number of Filled Non-ICU Beds)/(Total Number of Non-ICU Beds)

## Visualization
Excel-based grouped horizontal bar chart showing each metric for each hospital department. Checkbox filter also added to dynamically change appearance of graph to more clearly visualize visual patterns.

## Insights

Highest total occupancy percentages are present in Psychiatry (55%), Long-Term Care(57%), and Palliative Care (57%) Departments.

Highest ICU occupancy percentages are present in Orthopedic (67%) , Psychiatry (67%), and Neurosurgery (66%) Departments.

Highest Non-ICU occupancy percentages are present in Emergency Department (79%) , General Surgery (80%), and Trauma Center (76%) Departments.

Emergency Department, General Surgery, and Trauma Center Departments will require the most attention regarding capacity, given how much higher these percentage values are compared to other metrics and departments.
